distcc-0.12  "Klein, kosten- und schnörkellos"  2002-10-07

  BUG FIXES:

    * Handle "gcc -S foo.c -o -", which ought to write assembly to stdout.
      (Alexandre Oliva)

  PORTABILITY:

    * wait4() on Solaris can't handle a pid of -1, which means "any child" on
      Linux and BSD.  Use pid of 0 instead to collect any children from the
      same process group.  (Kevin Bailey)

  TESTING:

    * Add tests for "-o -".  (Martin Pool)
